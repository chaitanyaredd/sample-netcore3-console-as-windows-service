# sample-netcore3-console-as-windows-service
This is a sample .NET core console app which hosts a background job that can be run as windows service.  
This repo accompanies my [blog post](https://www.taithienbo.com/automatically-build-and-deploy-net-core-3-console-application-as-a-windows-service/) in which I go over the configs, setting up the build and release pipelines  
to automatically deploy and register the app as a windows service using azure devops.
